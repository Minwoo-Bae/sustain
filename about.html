      <h5 style="text-align: left">Minwoo Bae is an undergraduate student studying chemistry and biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Born and raised in South Korea where he is currently serving in military, Minwoo was fortunate to attend a privileged school, Seoul Science High School where he began to enjoy science. After receiving a gold medal at the 44th International Chemistry Olympiad, he decided to continue his study at one of the best colleges in the United States, the school of Woodward and Corey, MIT.</h5>
  
      <h5>Minwoo has his scientific interests spanning chemistry and biology. Developing new chemical reactions, unearthing noble molecules of therapeutic importance, and elucidating the mechanism of aging fall into his interests. For his freshman year, Minwoo conducted photoredox-catalyzed heterocyclic compound synthesis under a supervision of Professor Jamison, and now he aims at expanding the scope of Cu-catalyzed hydroamination in the Buchwald Lab. Minwoo has a dream one day his work would contribute to the society understanding the process of aging and, ultimately and boldly, overcoming aging, the inevitable fate of human being.</h5>
