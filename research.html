      Research interest

1. Developing easy-to-implement organic synthetic methods.

No one would deny that there has been a transformative progress in organic synthesis during the last century. We now possess an arsenal of reactions with unprecedented scope, yield and selectivity: CH functionalization, biorthogonal reactions and organometallic catalysts, just to name my favorites. 

Marvelous as the development is, equally perplexing is the article1) that reveals there have been almost no changes in the list of the most-used-reactions in drug making for the two decades. Instead of many state-of-art reactions that require expensive materials and harsh conditions, old reactions like amide formation with high commercial availability have still been dominating the industry.

My goal is to fill the gap between organic synthetic labs and drug companies by improving the state-of-art reactions so that they can be performed with minimal resource, effort and time.

2. Organic synthesis in biologics.

There are two types of drugs: small molecule drugs and protein based drugs, or biologics. Unlike small molecule drugs, which are products of organic synthesis, biologics are made from reprogrammed cells with recombinant DNA. 

The two different methods, organic synthesis and recombinant DNA, have their own pros and cons. But I believe we can do better maybe by combining those approaches, which idea is not my own but that of mother nature. In nature, in order to fully function, proteins wear specific clothes of chemical groups by enzymes. 

For biologics, their enzyme can be organic synthesis, which confers novel properties to them. For instance, placing a small molecule drug on an antibody by chemical protein modification methods gave a birth to antibody-drug conjugates, which show promising activity and specificity in therapy. The field, however, is yet largely unexplored. 

I’m interested in understanding the role of chemical moieties on protein, introducing the right chemical clothes on protein and developing the rationally modified proteins into new therapeutic agents.   

3. Understanding and preventing aging 

“Age is no more than a number” – Korean proverb meaning that we can’t judge people just by their ages. 
That’s right. Age is maybe just a number, but aging is something much more abstract and complex. 
Most diseases have their root causes: abnormally proliferating cells for cancer and immune system destroying insulin-making cells for diabetes. And we can treat those diseases by tackling their root causes. There is, however, no single cause for aging.
Aging is not a single phenomenon but multitude. In particular, I’m interested in the molecular aspect of aging, well exemplified by David Spiegel’s work2).
I would like to contribute in understanding the molecular aspect of aging and hopefully someday enjoy extra life thanks to my work.
